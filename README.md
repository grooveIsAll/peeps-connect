## Take Home React UI Challenge
Using the provided comp and assets, create a locally running page (via 'npm run start') that matches the layout and design. Time spent should be between 1-2hrs - we're looking more to gauge thought process and workflow rather than speed of completion.

### Additional Details
- Some of the provided image assets are slightly different from the overall comp - prefer the individual asset in this case
- The rest of the small icon assets can be clipped from the layout design (band links)
- Nav links and button CTAs must be links, but should all point to https://google.com
- "Intro" tagline should use exact copy as displayed
- All other paragragh text should be "Lorem ipsum" of similar length
- Layout should be reasonably responsive and stack vertically for mobile
